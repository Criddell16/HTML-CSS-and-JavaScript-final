My next steps:

In all of my files I would work on my style sheet (style.css) to make it a little more uniform and have more element included.

With my canvas portion I would work to add a lot more. Firstly I would try to work on the timing in the boxes movements once you hit the repeat button.
Next I would make it so I don't need the repeat button and it will continue to go back and forth forever by it self.
I would then change that repeat button into a button that when pressed changes the box to a random color.
Then since my inital idea was for the box to bounce around the screen like the dvd symbol does I would start to try to figure out how to change both the x and y cooridinates in an orderly 'disorder'.
